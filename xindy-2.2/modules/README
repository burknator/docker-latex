This directory contains a set of predefined modules that can be used
to describe your own indexstyle. The directory is organized as
follows:

   base/	standard xindy modules

   lang/        contains several modules specifying alphabets and
		letter groups for many languages.

   class/       some example classes

   tex/		TeX-specific stuff


These modules are intended to be used as a collection of examples that
can be used as a starting point for your own indexstyles. If you want
to profit others of your work, send us your indexstyles and we'll
incorporate your work into future releases.
