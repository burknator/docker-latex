The files in this directory can be used to process TeX-indexes with
xindy.

isolatin[12][ms].xdy:
	These files that contain sort and merge rules for handling ISO
	Latin characters. There are currently mappings for sort (s)
	and merge (m) rules for both ISO Latin 1 and 2 available.
        Basically they include each of the following two files.

isolatin[ms].xdy:
	Included ISO Latin mappings from the TeX ^^xy notation to the
	corresponding ISO Latin characters.

isolatin[12][ms].xdy:
	Included ISO Latin mappings from the TeX macro notation to the
	corresponding ISO Latin characters.

makeidx.xdy:
	A style file that makes xindy mostly behave as makeindex. It
	can be used as a starting point for further refinements.

makeidx4.xdy:
	A style file that is used by makeindex4.
